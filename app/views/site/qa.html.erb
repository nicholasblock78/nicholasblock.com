        <h3 class='question'>Name your proudest moment.</h3>
        <p class='answer'>Graduating Dev Bootcamp. Graduation day entails presenting your final project in front of family, friends, and peers. It's an entire week of work, an eternity by the bootcamp's standards, at the end of an already trying and intensive program. Committing to that program was life-changing, and the best part was that many of the other graduates shared the same sentiment.</p>

        <h3 class='question'>What would you do with a million dollars?</h3>
        <p class='answer'>I'd open up a vacation dog ranch paradise adoption center or a herb cocktail bar. The real answer, while financially responsible, isn't nearly as much fun -- invest. That kind of money brings a lot of opportunity to simply make more money and establish diversified streams of passive income.</p>
